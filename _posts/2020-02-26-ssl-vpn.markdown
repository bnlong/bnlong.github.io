Finally, my custom domain for the Jekyll blog started working. Normally, it is as easy step to adding a custom domain to a Heroku app like this: 
{% highlight shell %}
heroku domains:add todos.phuonglong.com
{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately, I followed this guide : https://blog.heroku.com/jekyll-on-heroku . It asked us to "https_only": true in the static.json. It caused the issue with SSL mismatch when redirection.
 
{% highlight shell %}
heroku git:clone -a blooming-blog
{% endhighlight %}
